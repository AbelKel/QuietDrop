# QuietDrop Test Suite

This directory contains integration tests for the QuietDrop application. These tests verify that different components of the system work correctly together.

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
cargo test test_name
```

To run tests with output:

```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

To run ignored tests (those marked with `#[ignore]`):

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored
```

## Test Files

### `encryption_integration_tests.rs`

Tests for the encryption system:
- `test_end_to_end_encryption`: Verifies encryption between users works
- `test_message_tampering_detection`: Ensures tampered messages are detected
- `test_key_specificity`: Confirms messages can only be decrypted by intended recipients

### `authentication_test.rs`

Tests for the authentication system:
- `test_salt_generation_uniqueness`: Verifies salts are unique
- `test_salt_file_operations`: Tests saving and loading salts from files
- `test_password_hashing_and_verification`: Tests password hashing/verification (ignored)
- `test_password_hash_consistency`: Tests consistent password hashing (ignored)

### `message_test.rs`

Tests for the message handling:
- `test_message_creation_and_encryption`: Tests creating and encrypting messages
- `test_message_serialization`: Tests serializing/deserializing messages
- `test_message_types`: Tests different message types (Text/File)

### `client_server_test.rs`

Tests for client-server interaction:
- `test_client_message_construction`: Tests client message creation
- `test_server_initialization`: Tests server startup (ignored)
- `test_client_server_communication`: Tests end-to-end communication (ignored)

## Ignored Tests

Several tests are currently marked with `#[ignore]` for specific reasons:

### Authentication Tests

The password hashing tests are ignored due to issues with Argon2 memory parameters. The error "MemoryTooLittle" suggests that the current implementation in the tests doesn't meet the minimum memory requirements for Argon2id as configured in your library.

To fix these tests in the future:
1. Review the exact Argon2 parameters used in your production code
2. Update the test parameters to match or exceed these requirements
3. Consider making the parameters configurable to support both testing and production environments

### Client-Server Tests

The server initialization and client-server communication tests are ignored because:
1. They require running both client and server components simultaneously
2. They need special setup like available network ports
3. They involve asynchronous code that's more complex to test
4. They might take longer to run than standard unit tests

To run these tests in the future, you'll need to set up a test environment with:
- A dedicated test server instance
- Mock clients or test fixtures
- Proper async runtime setup
- Resource cleanup after tests complete

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Use descriptive test names that clearly state what's being tested
2. Include assertions that verify expected behaviors
3. Clean up any resources created during tests
4. Mark tests that require external resources or take a long time with `#[ignore]`
5. Add test documentation to this README

## Testing Philosophy

QuietDrop's test strategy follows these principles:

1. **Security First**: Cryptographic and authentication functions are tested thoroughly
2. **Isolated Components**: Tests focus on specific components before testing integration
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests simulate actual user workflows
4. **Edge Cases**: Tests validate behavior under unusual or error conditions

Remember that tests are not just for catching bugs but also serve as documentation for how the system is expected to work.
